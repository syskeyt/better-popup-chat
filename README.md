# PopupChat 

PopupChat is an open anonymous instant chat room.

PopupChat is an Arduino sketch that turns your ESP8266 or ESP32 into an open wifi access
point that connects users to an anonymous chat room.  The user is (usually)
sent directly into a popup web browser with the software open as soon as they
connect to the wireless AP, because it acts like a Captive Portal (think "hotel
wifi").

To upload to your ESP32 or ESP8266, click the .ino file for your board, then drag .h and .ccp files into the folder Arduino IDE created. Install the right Arduino IDE core, and upload.
